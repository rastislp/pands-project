Petals are modified leaves that surround the reproductive parts of flowers. They are often brightly coloured or unusually shaped to attract pollinators. Together, all of the petals of a flower are called a corolla(Petal, 2020).

A sepal (/ˈsɛpəl/ or /ˈsiːpəl/) is a part of the flower of angiosperms (flowering plants). Usually green, sepals typically function as protection for the flower in bud, and often as support for the petals when in bloom (Sepal, 2020).
